Assignment Questions:

1. How are the syntaxes async and await useful when writing JavaScript code?
2. With respect to Knex, how does the transaction method relate to BEGIN and COMMIT syntax in PostgreSQL?
3. What is a "sequence table" in PostgreSQL?
4. What does RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE do?
5. What does SELECT setval('blogful_users_id_seq', 1) do?




General Question: 

1.  What is PostgreSQL SERIAL PRIMARY KEY?"
    First, create a sequence object and set the next value generated by the sequence as the default value for the column.
    Second, add a NOT NULL constraint to the id column because a sequence always generates an integer, which is a non-null value.
    Third, assign the owner of the sequence to the id column; as a result, the sequence object is deleted when the id column or table is dropped

    CREATE TABLE table_name(
        id SERIAL
    );                            equals ....

    This: 

    CREATE SEQUENCE table_name_id_seq;
    
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('table_name_id_seq')
    );
    
    ALTER SEQUENCE table_name_id_seq
    OWNED BY table_name.id;
